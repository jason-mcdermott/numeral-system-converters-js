Convert Decimal to Hexadecimal
----------------------------

Given a decimal number, get the hexadecimal equivalent:

0. create a map of decimal to hexadecimal values.
1. divide the input decimal number by 16.
2. if the number doesn't divide equally by 16, round down the answer to the nearest whole number.
3. save off the remainder (and all subsequent ones) in an array.
4. repeat the same steps, dividing each answer by 16 until you reach zero.
5. loop through all the remainders in reverse order (bottom to top) and get the hex value from the map.
