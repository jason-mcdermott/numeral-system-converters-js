Convert Decimal to Binary
----------------------------

Given a decimal number, get the binary equivalent:

1. create a binary series ([1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,...]
2. create an empty array of the same size, with all 0's.
3. take the decimal number and find the place in the binary
   series where the value is closest to the binary number
   without going over it.
4. put a 1 in that space in the empty array
5. subtract the binary value from the original number and repeat
   process to find the the next closest binary value without
   going over the decimal value
6. put a 1 in that space in the empty array
7. once there is no remainder, you have your binary number
