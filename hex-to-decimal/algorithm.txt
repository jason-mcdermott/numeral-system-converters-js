Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal
----------------------------

Given a hexadecimal number, get the decimal equivalent:

0. create a map of hexadecimal to decimal values.
1. loop through each of the characters of the hexadecimal number and get the mapped value
   and collect those in a stack (or in the case of this JS implementation, an array whose 
   order is then reversed).
2. loop through the values of the reversed array and (assuming the decimal value is not zero)
   "accumulate" the decimal value times 16^i where i is the index of the decimal value in the 
   array.
3. the final sum is the result.
